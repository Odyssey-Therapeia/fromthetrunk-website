# P5 — Channels & Control Centre (SEO/AEO, Meta sync, metrics baked in)
**Purpose:** distribution machinery: product feeds to Google & Meta, channel health + SEO/AEO + performance + revenue metrics pulled into one admin Control Centre. **Entry:** #G-GST resolved (P2-03/04), #G-DOMAIN resolved, P4 catalog shape (feeds read types/attributes). **Exit gate:** #G-P5 — feeds approved in both consoles, Control Centre live with real data.

External-console latency is real: Merchant Center review 3–5 business days; preloved goods need GTIN-exemption (`identifier_exists=false`). Sequence console submissions EARLY in the phase.

### P5-00 (spike): channel account audit (ops + doc)
Findings doc: state of Google Merchant Center, Search Console property (which domain — post #G-DOMAIN), Meta Business/Commerce Manager, API access (service account for GSC/GA4, Meta system user token, Vercel API token). Lists every credential needed with owner. Nothing ships without this inventory.
- [x] (2026-06-14, docs/spikes/channel-audit.md, "credential checklist (owner=user, BATCHED for P5-03/#G-P5: GMC, GSC SA+property, GA4 Data API, Vercel API token, Meta system-user+catalog id, FEEDS_PUBLIC_TOKEN) + the committed feed-mapping decisions (GST-inclusive price, availability from quantities, condition=used, identifier_exists=false GTIN-exemption, json-ld description fallback, absolute Blob URLs, exclusions) + GTIN-exemption flow + P5-04 adapter scope + assumptions A-CH1..4. Code feeds/adapters built+fixture-tested; consoles batched. Orchestrator-written planning doc.")

### P5-01: Google Merchant feed
`GET /api/v2/feeds/google-merchant.xml` over `listProducts` (the sitemap's exact query): GST-inclusive price (P2-04), availability from quantities (P4-05), `condition=used`, `identifier_exists=false`, description fallback chain (storyNarrative→storyTitle→name+fabric — mirror `lib/seo/json-ld.ts:19-21`), absolute Blob image URLs, landing pages `/collection/{slug}`. Feed-level exclusions: drafts, the test product, zero-image items. Secured? No — feeds are public by design; add a static token query param anyway to deter scraping. Ladder: +L2 (XML schema-validated in test) — plus Google's own feed debugger as ops evidence.
- [x] (2026-06-14, 4fb5623, "valid Google Merchant RSS 2.0 over the SAME listProducts query as the sitemap [byte-identical]; shared lib/channels/feed-mapping.ts [P5-02 reuses]; price=pricePaise/100 mirroring json-ld [GST backed out not added → feed price===PDP, mutation-proven]; availability via deriveStockStatus+batched getBatchActiveReservationsCounts [flag-aware, expired-reservation→in_stock proven through live HTTP route]; condition=used + identifier_exists=false; absolute link/getSiteOrigin; exclusions [draft/test-product/zero-image] mutation-proven ABSENT on PARSED XML; FEEDS_PUBLIC_TOKEN deterrent [403 set+wrong]; tsc 0; 1192 tests [XML parsed not string-matched]; opus 3-lens ACCEPT. Console submission BATCHED P5-03.")
- [ ] P5-01a: token comparison (feeds.ts:148 `provided !== configuredToken`) is NOT timing-safe; repo convention is crypto.timingSafeEqual via lib/http/verify-secret.ts verifyBearerSecret. Non-blocking (public feed; token guards already-public data) — switch to a constant-time compare for consistency.
- [ ] P5-01b: g:image_link absoluteness not enforced — resolveMediaURL can return a RELATIVE path and Google rejects relative image_link; also a product whose images all resolve to null passes the zero-image count check yet emits an item with NO g:image_link (invalid Google item). Latent (prod Blob URLs are absolute https). Fix: prefix non-absolute image URLs with getSiteOrigin() (like link) + exclude items whose resolved first image is null/relative.

### P5-02: Meta catalog feed
Same query → Meta CSV/XML dialect; shared mapping module `lib/channels/feed-mapping.ts` so the two feeds cannot drift. Ladder: +L2.
- [x] (2026-06-14, f002c55, "Meta product-catalog CSV at /api/v2/feeds/meta-catalog.csv over the SAME listProducts query, REUSING lib/channels/feed-mapping.ts mapProductToFeedItem + shouldExcludeFromFeed + the v2 batched-reservations availability path [NO reimplemented price/availability/description/exclusion in the Meta serializer]; mutation-proven no-drift [changing feed-mapping price /100→/1000 or the availability ternary fails BOTH feeds]; required Meta fields in Meta vocab; RFC-4180 PARSED tests; exclusions mutation-proven ABSENT; FEEDS_PUBLIC_TOKEN gate; Content-Type text/csv; Google feed unregressed [feed-mapping.ts byte-identical to HEAD]; tsc 0; 1225 tests; opus 3-lens ACCEPT. Console submission BATCHED P5-03.")
- [ ] P5-02a: the named "reuse" cross-check tests (Meta price/availability/description == Google) only prove equality, not value-correctness (the real mutation-kill is the absolute-value tests). Add an absolute-literal assertion alongside each reuse test (e.g. stockStatus 'reserved' → 'out_of_stock') for independent mutation-kill value.
- [ ] P5-02b: Meta additional_image_link emits only the FIRST additional image (feeds.ts:229); Meta CSV supports up to 20 (comma-separated in one column) and the Google RSS feed emits all. No drift (same FeedItem source) but extra saree detail shots are dropped from Meta. Emit a comma-separated list (escapeCsvCell already quotes) for image parity.

### P5-03 (ops): console wiring
Submit feeds, GTIN-exemption flow, shipping (₹500/standard, free ≥ ₹25,000 — `lib/config/order-pricing.ts`) and returns config in both consoles; Search Console property + sitemap submission; request indexing on top pages. Evidence: screenshots/status into `docs/internal/channel-setup.md`.
**Depends**: P5-01, P5-02. Start review clocks ASAP.

### P5-04: Pull adapters (read-only ports)
`lib/ports/channel-metrics.ts` with adapters: `search-console` (indexation, top queries, CTR), `ga4-data` (sessions, conversion rate, revenue attribution), `vercel-insights` (CWV p75, deploy markers), `meta-marketing` (catalog diagnostics, pixel event health vs CAPI — dedup parity check). Each adapter: typed client, error-isolated, unit-tested against fixture responses. Cron `/api/v2/cron/refresh-channel-metrics` (CRON_SECRET pattern from `api/hono/routes/cron.ts`) caches into `channel_metrics` table.
- [x] (2026-06-14, 4e1628e, "channel-metrics port + 4 read-only adapters [search-console/ga4-data/vercel-insights/meta-marketing], typed + ENV-GATED [creds-absent→typed-zero, no throw] + error-isolated; each parses a realistic FIXTURE into typed metrics [mutation-proven values, no live calls]; pullAllMetrics outer .catch() isolation INDEPENDENTLY mutation-proven [bare rejecting adapter→others survive; removing .catch() fails test]; cron /api/v2/cron/refresh-channel-metrics CRON_SECRET-gated calls pullAllMetrics + UPSERTs channel_metrics [mutation-proven table+source+value]; drizzle/0011 IF-NOT-EXISTS parse-valid NOT run; tsc 0; 1249 tests; opus 3-lens ACCEPT [after soft verifier block on per-layer isolation → test-strength repair]. Console creds/cron-schedule + migration 0011 BATCHED.")
- [ ] P5-04a: the INNER catch layer in 3 adapters (search-console, ga4-data, vercel-insights) is not independently mutation-provable — the "fetch fails" tests use a !response.ok 401 fixture (early-return path), so a real fetch() REJECTION (which hits the inner catch) is reached by no test (the outer .catch absorbs it redundantly). Live in prod, untested. Add inner-catch coverage (drive fetch to reject through a path the outer catch can't reach) OR document defense-in-depth.
- [ ] P5-04b: the upsert test's fixture→adapter mapping relies on Promise.all index order for mockResolvedValueOnce (deterministic today; assertions look up by source so won't silently pass wrong data, but a future sync-work change in an adapter could shift the mapping). Key fixtures to URL substrings via fetchMock.mockImplementation to remove the ordering dependency.

### P5-05: Control Centre admin page
One admin dashboard composing `channel_metrics` + internal `events` (P2-07): revenue funnel (sessions→PDP→checkout→paid), feed health (item counts, disapprovals), indexation trend, CWV trend, pixel/CAPI parity, reservation-expiry rate. Built from MetricCard/ActivityFeed patterns already in the admin dashboard. Ladder: +L3.
- [ ]

### P5-06: AEO pass
`llms.txt`; FAQPage schema via the P3 FAQ block on a real FAQ page; Organization/Product schema completeness audit as a test (every published PDP emits valid Product+Offer — extend P1-16's rendered-output test to iterate fixtures); OG images for PDPs (template-generated via `next/og`).
- [ ]

### P5-07: Reservation-expiry / abandoned-checkout email
The verified-feasible week-2 item: query orders `paymentStatus=pending` older than hold window; dedupe via `reminder_sent_at` column (migration); transactional framing ("your reservation expired — the piece may still be available"), live `quantity_available` check before send; deep-link to cart, not the dead payment link. Consent: transactional only, no marketing copy. **Depends**: P1-03 (Resend errors), P2-05.
Ladder: +L2.

### #G-P5: USER CHECKPOINT
Evidence: both feeds approved (or itemized disapproval remediation), Control Centre screenshot with live data, first GA4 conversion recorded end-to-end (pixel + CAPI deduped), CWV baseline.
