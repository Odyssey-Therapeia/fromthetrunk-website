# P2 — Platform Foundation
**Purpose:** the shared substrate P3–P5 stand on: the form-from-schema engine, inventory v2, GST pricing decision, durable rate limiting, server-event pipeline, Payload excision, design-system contract, test harness factory. **Entry:** #G-P1 passed. **Exit gate:** #G-P2 (engine demo + migration rehearsal evidence) plus the two business gates **#G-GST** and **#G-DOMAIN** resolved.

### P2-00 (spike): form-engine survey
Findings doc `docs/spikes/form-engine.md`: inventory every admin form (product stepper, status editors, settings), the TanStack Form usage and its `any` clusters (`step-details.tsx`, `step-story.tsx`), and shadcn primitives available; define the field-type set the engine must cover (text, textarea, rich-ish text, number, money-paise, select, multi-select, boolean, image-ref, list-of-group, conditional). No code. Ladder: L5 only.

### P2-01: `lib/forms` schema→form core ⭐ keystone
Zod schema + field metadata → form model (sections, fields, validation). Pure, heavily unit-tested (target: every field type + nested groups + conditionals). No React in this layer.
**Verify**: `npm test` new suite ≥ 25 cases. **Depends**: P2-00.
**P2-00 inputs (from spike)**: FT-03 rich-text has no installed editor primitive — select Tiptap/Markdown or defer rich-text to textarea in v1; FT-07 multi-select needs shadcn Command (add it or formalise CSV-text); **settings shipping fields hold RUPEES not paise** (spike M1 — money-paise type is for product pricePaise only); FT-11 conditional already live in step-pricing.tsx:155-202 (doc-and-enforce).
- [x] (2026-06-13, b9e5154, "lib/forms pure engine; 46 tests (320 suite); all 11 field types; mutation-proven (z.any→9 fail, strip showIf→2 fail); tsc clean; ACCEPT-WITH-MINORS")
- [ ] P2-01a: add malformed list-of-group (FT-10) rejection test (only field type lacking a negative case); vet & adopt-or-delete the pre-existing untracked tests/unit/forms-types.test.ts (13 tests, now exercises the real engine).
- [ ] P2-01b: FT-10 `itemSchema` is display-only — buildZodSchema validates only the top-level array zod, ignores itemSchema (can drift). Add `buildListItemZod(itemSchema)` helper OR document loudly. Route to P2-02 (renderer) / P4-01 (type-schema builder).

### P2-02: `components/admin/schema-form` renderer
React renderer over the form model using existing shadcn components only (design guardrail applies). Replace ONE existing form (product stepper details step) as the proving ground — kills the 15 `any`s as a side effect.
**Verify**: L0–L3 (e2e: edit a product via the new form). **Depends**: P2-01.
- [x] (2026-06-13, 541a64a, "schema-form-field renders all 11 types to shadcn; step-details refactored, 10 anys killed; 41 tests (361); tsc+lint+drift clean; ACCEPT-WITH-MINORS; L3 e2e→#G-P2 demo")
- [ ] P2-02a: build the schema-DRIVEN full `SchemaForm` component (FormSchema + values + onChange → deriveFormModel + SchemaFormField across sections, per-field buildZodSchema validation) and make ≥1 real form consume a schema as single source of truth (step-details currently hand-assembles field metadata inline; orphan product-details.schema.ts was removed). Completes the keystone's "no per-type UI code" purpose (D3). **PREREQUISITE for P3-05 (page block editor) and P4-02 (product-attribute forms).**

### P2-03: #G-GST — GST-inclusive pricing decision (USER GATE)
Present the options with numbers: (a) display GST-inclusive everywhere (sticker price rises, checkout shows "incl. GST"), (b) absorb GST into pricePaise. Decision blocks P5 feeds. Evidence pack: current price flow (`razorpay.ts:182`, PDP `:183`, JSON-LD), Google India feed policy summary.
- [x] (2026-06-13, user decision: GST-inclusive prices going forward. pricePaise → GST-inclusive; checkout add-on removed in P2-04. Unblocks P5.)

### P2-04: Implement chosen GST pricing site-wide
PDP, cart, checkout totals (`calculateOrderTotals`), JSON-LD offers, emails — one consistent number; unit tests for the new math everywhere money renders. **Depends**: P2-03. Ladder: +L2, L3.
- [ ]

### P2-05: Inventory v2 schema + dual-write
`quantity_available` + `reservations` table; migration backfills from stock_status (available→1, sold→0, reserved→1+row); compatibility layer keeps `stockStatus` derivable (generated column or query-level) so existing UI/feed code keeps working until P4 consumes quantities. Atomic claim moves to `reservations` insert with conditional quantity check; release-reservations cron rewritten against the table. **Rehearse on a Neon branch; #G-P2 reviews the rehearsal diff/rowcounts before prod migrate.** Ladder: +L2.
- [ ]

### P2-06: Durable rate limiting
Upstash (or Vercel KV-successor via Marketplace) adapter behind `lib/ports/rate-limiter.ts`; in-memory adapter remains for dev/tests. Wire payment:create, try-on, sign-up.
- [ ]

### P2-07: Server-event pipeline
`lib/ports/analytics-sink.ts` + adapters `internal-events` (new `events` table), `ga4-measurement-protocol`, `meta-capi` (event_id dedup with the P1-18 pixel). Emit: order_created, payment_completed (inside the P1-04 idempotent winner branch), reservation_expired. Fan-out is fire-and-forget with error logging — never blocks the money path. Ladder: +L2.
- [ ]

### P2-08: Payload excision
Remove 5 `@payloadcms/*` packages + `payload`, `payload.config.ts`, `payload:*` scripts; archive `scripts/migrate-payload-to-drizzle.ts` under `scripts/archive/`; drop `--legacy-peer-deps` from CI; also delete unused `lenis`. **Verify**: `npm ci` without the flag; `npm run verify` green; bundle/install delta recorded.
- [ ]

### P2-09: Structured logger
`lib/log.ts` (level, namespace, JSON in prod) replacing the 16 ad-hoc console.* in lib/+api/; onError (P1-09) routes through it.
- [ ]

### P2-10: `docs/design-system.md` — the token contract
Document the Tailwind v4 variable tokens, type scale, spacing, component inventory; add the mechanical drift checks (no raw hex / px) to the verifier's standard checklist. UI packets in P3+ cite this doc.
- [x] (2026-06-13, 2b7834f, "docs/design-system.md: real Tailwind v4 tokens + 21 ui primitives + drift greps; adversarial ACCEPT")

### P2-11: Route-test factory
Extract the mocked-db Hono harness from `admin-user-management-routes.test.ts` into `tests/helpers/route-harness.ts`; port 2 existing tests to prove it. Target: writing an L2 test for a new route ≤ 30 lines.
- [x] (2026-06-13, d7ab795, "tests/helpers/route-harness.ts; admin 185→158, payments 572→456; 261 tests; adversarial ACCEPT mutation-proven")

### #G-P2: USER CHECKPOINT
Demo: schema-form editing a product; inventory-v2 rehearsal evidence (Neon branch, rowcounts, rollback plan); pricing decision implemented and visible; CI green without legacy-peer-deps.
